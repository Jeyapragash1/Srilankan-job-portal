# Job Portal Project

## Project Overview

This **Job Portal** project is a web-based platform designed to connect students, graduates, and job seekers with potential employers. The portal allows companies to post job listings, while students and graduates can search, view, and apply for jobs that match their skills and career goals. This platform streamlines the job-seeking process and helps bridge the gap between employers and job seekers.

### Key Features

- **Job Search**: Students and graduates can search for available jobs using various filters (e.g., job title, location, type).
- **Job Application**: Users can apply for jobs directly through the portal by submitting their application materials.
- **Company Job Postings**: Employers can create accounts to post job openings and manage applicants.
- **User Accounts**: Separate roles for students, graduates, and companies with personalized dashboards and functionalities.

### Technologies Used

- **Front-End**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly design.
- **Back-End**:
  - Java and JSP (JavaServer Pages) for dynamic web page generation and server-side processing.
- **Database**:
  - A relational database (e.g., MySQL) to store job listings, user profiles, applications, and other data.

### Project Structure

- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, organized into pages for job search, application forms, login/signup, and company dashboards.
- **Back-End**: JSP pages and Java servlets for handling requests, interacting with the database, and rendering responses.
- **Database**: Tables for users, job listings, applications, and other related entities.
